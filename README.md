## Prerequisites
Before running the application and tests, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js
- npm
- Your preferred IDE

## How to Run the Application
1. Clone this Git repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/helioLJ/credit-card-validation-web
```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.

3. Install the dependencies using npm by running the following command in the project's root directory:

```bash
npm install
```
4. Start the React application by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the application, and it will be accessible at http://localhost:5173.

## Site Usage
The application exposes a simple form for credit card validation. You can generate fake credit card information using this [site](https://www.creditcardvalidator.org/generator).

The layout will display with either "Success!" if the credit card information is valid or "Invalid Credit Card information." if it's not.

The Card Issuer logo will change dynamically.
